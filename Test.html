    <br><br><br><p id="paragraph01">CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced iPhone 16e, a new addition to <br> the iPhone 16 lineup that offers powerful capabilities at a more affordable price. <br> iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, <br> thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1, <br> the first cellular modem designed by Apple. iPhone 16e is also built for Apple <br> Intelligence, the intuitive personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and <br> relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. <br> The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, <br> and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like having two cameras in one, so users can zoom <br> in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, Apple’s <br> groundbreaking satellite features — including Emergency SOS, Roadside <br> Assistance, Messages, and Find My via satellite — help iPhone 16e users stay <br> connected and get assistance when it matters most.1 <br><br><br><br>
        iPhone 16e will be available in two elegant matte finishes — black and white —  <br>with colorful cases available to accessorize. Pre-orders begin Friday, February 21, <br> with availability beginning Friday, February 28. <br><br><br><br>
        “iPhone 16e packs in the features our users love about the iPhone 16 lineup, including breakthrough battery life, fast performance powered by the latest-generation A18 chip, an innovative 2-in-1 camera system, and Apple Intelligence,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “We’re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people.”</p>
